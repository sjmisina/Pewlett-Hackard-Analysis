## Analysis Overview  
### Retirement Analysis  
With retirement age coming up for many employees in the near future, an anaylisis of this personnel has been produced. We have identified these employees by their date of birth, and have compiled a list of these candidates along with the number functional titles that will be vacated. This information is scattered across 6 different internal databases, and compiled here for your review.  

### Mentorship Analysis
Along with the expected attrition of the coming "silver tsunami," there will be a great need to replace many positions and therefore our mature staff at Pewlett Hackard can serve as mentors to ensure our company culture and standards can be passed along to the next generation of leaders and senior positions. A roster of projected eligible PH employees that can serve in this mentorship role has been generated and presented here as part of this analysis.  

## Results  
There are a large number of functional roles that will be vacated through retirement, as identified by the existing roles that will be open by number.  

In recognizing our employees for their years of service and professional achivements, we have the opportunity to determine how to absorb their responsibilities by  restructuring existing roles, creating new roles, or by directly supplanting the employee. This will be key for business continuity as PH moves into the 21st century.
