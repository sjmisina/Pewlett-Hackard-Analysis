## Overview  
### Retirement Analysis. 
With retirement age attained by many employees in the coming years, an anaylisis of these retirees has been produced. We have identified these employees by their date of birth, and have compiled a list of these candidates along with the number functional titles that will be vacated. This information is scattered across 6 different internal databases, and compiled here for your review.  

### Mentorship Analysis
Along with the expected attrition of the coming "silver tsunami," there will be a great need to replace many positions and therefore our mature staff at Pewlett Hackard can serve as mentors to ensure our company culture and standards can be passed along to the next generation of leaders and senior positions. A roster of projected eligible PH employees that can serve in this mentorship role has been generated and presented here as part of this analysis.
